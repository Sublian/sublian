### 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are some of my key public projects that showcase my approach to building and learning:

#### 🔐 **Professional Django API Template**
*(Django • Docker • JWT • PostgreSQL • Pytest)*
A production-ready, reusable template for secure backend APIs. Features JWT authentication with refresh token rotation, a role-based permission system (admin/staff/client), rate limiting, and a fully containerized setup with Docker.
<br>**Highlight:** Designed as a modern foundation for SaaS, mobile backends, or microservices, with a complete test suite from the start. <br>
`⚙️ Django` `🐳 Docker` `🔒 JWT` `🐘 PostgreSQL` `🧪 Pytest`

### 📈 Achievements & Metrics

- **Legacy System Optimization:** Achieved a **45x performance improvement** in a critical Odoo module, reducing processing time from over 20 hours to under 3 hours through strategic profiling and query optimization.
- **Database Performance:** Improved complex query response times by **300%** using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and strategic indexing on tables with 10,000+ records.
- **Goal:** Implement 90%+ test coverage across all main repositories and integrate CI/CD for automated quality assurance.

---

### 🌱 Currently & Next Steps

- **Working on:** Optimizing and progressively migrating a legacy Odoo v13 system to **Django RestFramework**.
- **Learning:** Microservices architecture and expanding my AWS cloud expertise.
- **Collaboration:** Interested in Python open-source projects, developer tools, and technical documentation (like [python-docs-es](https://github.com/python/python-docs-es)).
