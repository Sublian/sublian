# Hello! 👋 I'm Luis Gonzalez
### Software Engineer | Python Backend Specialist | Lifelong Learner

I'm a Software Engineer with over 2 years of experience specializing in backend development with Python. My expertise focuses on high-performance system optimization, process automation, and implementing scalable architectures using Django, FastAPI, Flask, and Odoo.

I'm passionate about solving complex performance bottlenecks, applying solid design patterns, and writing clean, maintainable code. I believe in building robust systems backed by automated testing and modern DevOps practices.

---

### 🧠 Active Learning & Skill Development

I firmly believe in learning by doing and maintaining a structured approach to growth. For the last quarter of 2025, I'm running a focused **Upskilling Project** to deepen my expertise in key areas.

**🎯 T1-Upskilling-2025: Structured Learning Project**

I use a **GitHub Project Board** to plan, track, and document my learning journey. Each skill or concept is broken down into actionable issues, linked directly to the code I write in dedicated practice repositories.

*   **Purpose:** Systematically advance in backend architecture, advanced testing, and modern DevOps.
*   **Methodology:** Theory → Practice → Code Repository → Documentation.
*   **Current Focus Areas:** Advanced Pytest patterns, Microservices design, and AWS fundamentals.
*   **👉 [View my Upskilling Project Board & Progress](https://github.com/users/Sublian/projects/2)**

This public board reflects my commitment to deliberate practice and transparent skill-building.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are some of my key public projects that showcase my approach to building and learning:

#### 🔐 **Professional Django API Template** ⭐ *100% Test Coverage Achieved*
*(Django • Docker • JWT • PostgreSQL • Pytest)*

A production-ready, reusable template for secure backend APIs. Features JWT authentication with refresh token rotation, a role-based permission system (admin/staff/client), rate limiting, and a fully containerized setup with Docker.

**🏆 Latest Achievement:** Reached **100% test coverage** with 62+ comprehensive tests, including integration tests for all API endpoints, authentication flows, and permission systems. This demonstrates professional-grade quality assurance practices.

**Highlights:** 
- Complete test suite from the start with Factory Boy and advanced mocking
- Designed as a modern foundation for SaaS, mobile backends, or microservices
- CI/CD ready with automated testing workflows
