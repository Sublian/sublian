# Hello! 👋 I'm Luis Gonzalez  

### Software Engineer · Python Backend Specialist · Lifelong Learner  

I'm a **Backend Python Engineer** with 2+ years working on production systems, specializing in API design, process automation, and high-performance backend services using Django, FastAPI, Flask, and Odoo. My work is focused on building scalable, maintainable architectures that are easy to evolve and operate in real-world environments.

I enjoy tackling complex performance bottlenecks, designing clear and robust abstractions, and writing clean, well-tested code that teams can rely on over time. I care about code quality, observability, and modern DevOps practices to ensure systems are not only functional, but reliable in production.

### 🧠 Active Learning & Skill Development

I believe in learning by doing and following a structured approach to growth. I run an ongoing **Upskilling Project** to deepen my expertise in core backend and DevOps skills.

**🎯 T1-Upskilling-2025: Structured Learning Project**

I use a **GitHub Project Board** to plan, track, and document my learning journey. Each skill or concept is broken down into actionable issues, linked directly to the code I write in dedicated practice repositories.

- **Purpose:** Systematically advance in backend architecture, advanced testing, and modern DevOps.
- **Methodology:** Theory → Practice → Code Repository → Documentation.
- **Current Focus Areas:** Advanced Pytest patterns, microservices design, and AWS fundamentals.
- **👉 [View my Upskilling Project Board & Progress](https://github.com/users/Sublian/projects/2)**

This public board reflects my commitment to deliberate practice, continuous improvement, and transparent skill-building.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are some key public projects that represent how I design, test, and ship backend systems.

#### 🔐 **Professional Django API Template** · *100% test coverage*
*(Django • Docker • JWT • PostgreSQL • Pytest)*  

Production-ready, reusable template for secure backend APIs. Includes JWT authentication with refresh token rotation, a role-based permission system (admin/staff/client), rate limiting, and a fully containerized setup with Docker.  

**Testing:** Reached **100% test coverage** with 60+ tests, including integration coverage for API endpoints, authentication flows, and permissions, following professional QA practices.  

**Highlights:**  
- Factory Boy–based test data, advanced mocking, and end-to-end API tests  
- Designed as a modern foundation for SaaS, mobile backends, or microservices  
- CI/CD-friendly structure with automated test workflows

### 📈 Achievements & Metrics

- **Testing Excellence:** Achieved **100% test coverage** on my Django API Template (60+ tests, including integration suites for endpoints, auth flows, and permissions), reflecting strong, automated QA practices.  
- **Legacy System Optimization (Odoo):** Delivered a **45x performance improvement** on a critical module, reducing processing time from 20+ hours to under 3 hours through profiling, query refactors, and better indexing.  
- **Database Performance:** Improved complex query response times by **300%** on tables with 10,000+ records using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, strategic indexing, and query simplification.  
- **Quality Discipline:** Aim to keep **90%+ test coverage** on main repositories and rely on CI/CD pipelines for continuous, automated quality checks.
